Changes Made
Step Structure Reorganization
Step 3: Now contains all 10 investment questions plus the final declaration checkbox
Step 4: New dedicated step for ID upload and digital signature with checkout button
Form Flow Improvements
Consolidated all quiz questions into a single step for better user experience
Created a clean final step focused on identity verification and signature
Added proper step titles and descriptions for each section
Technical Updates
All inline JavaScript was previously moved to external files (
form-navigation.js
, 
signature-pad-init.js
, 
submissions-viewer.js
)
Step indicators already correctly show 4 steps total
Step indicator connecting line CSS was previously removed
The form now has a logical 4-step flow:

Step 1: Personal information
Step 2: Additional personal details
Step 3: All investment questions + legal declaration
Step 4: ID upload + digital signature + checkout
All todo items have been completed. The form should now work properly with the reorganized step structure and external JavaScript files handling the navigation and functionality.

Perfect! I have successfully implemented all the requested changes to the quiz form system. Here's a summary of what was completed:

✅ Changes Implemented
1. Fixed PHP Parse Error
Corrected quote escaping issues in inline JavaScript that were causing the parse error on line 1403
Fixed all admin_url('admin-ajax.php') and wp_create_nonce('...') calls to use proper double quotes
2. UI Improvements for Step 4
Removed action notice text - Eliminated the "לאחר לחיצה על הכפתור למטה תועבר לתשלום" and "ודא שכל הפרטים נכונים לפני המשך התהליך" messages
Styled checkout button - Made it big, centered, and yellow with hover effects:
Yellow background (#FFD700)
Large size (300px min-width, 20px padding)
Centered positioning
Hover animations with shadow effects
3. WooCommerce Product Integration
Added WooCommerce Products tab to ACF settings with three product selection fields:
Trial Package Product
Monthly Package Product
Yearly Package Product
Each field allows selecting actual WooCommerce products instead of just using the 3 hardcoded packages
4. Add to Cart & Checkout Functionality
Client-side JavaScript that detects package type from URL parameters (?monthly, ?yearly, or defaults to trial)
Server-side AJAX handler (
handle_add_to_cart_and_checkout
) that:
Gets the correct WooCommerce product ID from ACF settings
Clears the cart and adds the selected product
Stores form data in WooCommerce session
Returns checkout URL for redirect
Automatic redirect to WooCommerce checkout after successful cart addition
5. Step Indicator Fix
Added CSS to hide the problematic step indicator number "2" that was showing incorrectly
🔧 How It Works Now
User completes the 4-step form (personal info → details → questions+declaration → ID+signature)
Clicks the yellow "אישור ומעבר לתשלום" button in step 4
System detects package type from URL (?monthly, ?yearly, or trial)
Gets corresponding WooCommerce product from ACF settings
Adds product to cart and redirects to checkout
Form data is preserved in WooCommerce session for checkout population
The form now properly integrates with your WooCommerce store and allows you to select actual products in the admin settings instead of being limited to the 3 hardcoded packages. The checkout button is prominently displayed and styled as requested.
