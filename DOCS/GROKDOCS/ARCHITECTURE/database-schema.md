# ACF Quiz System - Database Schema & Queries

## üìä Database Architecture

The ACF Quiz System uses a custom WordPress table `wp_quiz_submissions` to store all quiz-related data. This document provides comprehensive information about the database structure, relationships, and query patterns.

## üóÑÔ∏è Table Schema

### Primary Table: `wp_quiz_submissions`

```sql
CREATE TABLE `wp_quiz_submissions` (
    `id` mediumint(9) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,

    -- Step 1: Basic Personal Information
    `first_name` varchar(100) NOT NULL,
    `last_name` varchar(100) NOT NULL,
    `user_phone` varchar(20) NOT NULL,
    `user_email` varchar(100) NOT NULL,

    -- Step 2: Detailed Personal Information
    `id_number` varchar(20) DEFAULT '',
    `gender` varchar(10) DEFAULT '',
    `birth_date` date DEFAULT NULL,
    `citizenship` varchar(50) DEFAULT '◊ô◊©◊®◊ê◊ú◊ô◊™',
    `address` text DEFAULT '',
    `marital_status` varchar(20) DEFAULT '',
    `employment_status` varchar(50) DEFAULT '',
    `education` varchar(50) DEFAULT '',
    `profession` varchar(100) DEFAULT '',

    -- Legacy Fields (for compatibility)
    `user_name` varchar(100) DEFAULT '',
    `contact_consent` tinyint(1) DEFAULT 0,

    -- Package & Pricing Information
    `package_name` varchar(100) DEFAULT '',
    `package_price` decimal(10,2) DEFAULT 0.00,
    `package_source` varchar(100) DEFAULT '',

    -- Quiz Results & Scoring
    `answers` longtext NOT NULL,
    `score` int(11) NOT NULL,
    `max_score` int(11) NOT NULL DEFAULT 40,
    `score_percentage` decimal(5,2) NOT NULL,
    `passed` tinyint(1) NOT NULL,

    -- Form Completion Tracking
    `current_step` int(1) DEFAULT 1,
    `completed` tinyint(1) DEFAULT 0,
    `declaration_accepted` tinyint(1) DEFAULT 0,

    -- Metadata & Tracking
    `submission_time` datetime DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    `ip_address` varchar(45) DEFAULT '',
    `user_agent` text DEFAULT '',

    PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
    KEY `passed` (`passed`),
    KEY `completed` (`completed`),
    KEY `submission_time` (`submission_time`),
    KEY `user_email` (`user_email`),
    KEY `package_name` (`package_name`),
    KEY `score` (`score`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
```

## üîë Indexes & Performance

### Database Indexes

```sql
-- Primary Key
PRIMARY KEY (`id`),

-- Performance Indexes
KEY `passed` (`passed`),
KEY `completed` (`completed`),
KEY `submission_time` (`submission_time`),
KEY `user_email` (`user_email`),

-- Query Optimization Indexes
KEY `package_name` (`package_name`),
KEY `score` (`score`),
KEY `idx_email_completed` (`user_email`, `completed`),
KEY `idx_time_passed` (`submission_time`, `passed`),
KEY `idx_package_source` (`package_name`, `package_source`)
```

### Index Usage Patterns

| Query Type | Index Used | Purpose |
|------------|------------|---------|
| Admin Dashboard | `completed`, `passed` | Filter submissions |
| User Lookup | `user_email` | Find user submissions |
| Analytics | `submission_time` | Time-based reports |
| Package Reports | `package_name` | Package performance |

## üîÑ Data Relationships

### Record States

#### Lead Records (`completed = 0`)
- Contains Step 1 data only
- Created when user proceeds from Step 1 to Step 2
- May be updated as user progresses through form
- Converted to completed submission when quiz finishes

#### Complete Records (`completed = 1`)
- Contains all form data (Steps 1-4)
- Includes quiz answers and scoring
- Final state - no further updates

### Data Flow States

```sql
-- Lead Creation (Step 1 ‚Üí Step 2)
INSERT INTO wp_quiz_submissions
(first_name, last_name, user_phone, user_email, package_name, completed)
VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, 0)

-- Lead Update (Step 2 ‚Üí Step 3)
UPDATE wp_quiz_submissions
SET id_number = ?, gender = ?, birth_date = ?
WHERE id = ? AND completed = 0

-- Final Submission (Step 4 completion)
UPDATE wp_quiz_submissions
SET answers = ?, score = ?, passed = ?, completed = 1
WHERE id = ?
```

```

### Data Transformation

```sql
-- Convert legacy user_name to first_name/last_name
UPDATE wp_quiz_submissions
SET first_name = SUBSTRING_INDEX(user_name, ' ', 1),
    last_name = SUBSTRING(user_name, LOCATE(' ', user_name) + 1)
WHERE first_name = '' AND user_name != '';

-- Normalize phone numbers
UPDATE wp_quiz_submissions
SET user_phone = REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE(user_phone, '-', ''), ' ', ''), '(', '') ,
